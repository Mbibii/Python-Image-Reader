Little program I am working on to import an image file.
That file will then have each pixel read - for now I want it so then if it's white it will output 0, if it's anything else 1.
At some point it will just read coordinates - which it does already, but I want a bit more control - and I'm tired so I can't be bothered.

Will need to be outputted into a text file to be inputted into a program like unity.

Improved the program by adding the image file reading and adding a VERY BASIC output system
